Going to USA!
===========

Ready? GO! I am starting a really big adventure that will last not less than 8 months.   
This adventure is named **UCEAP**: [University of California, Educational Abroad Program](http://eap.ucop.edu/ReciprocalExchanges/Pages/default.aspx)

<img src="/images/uceap.png" style="border: 4px solid #eee"/>

UCEAP is a student exchange program that permits to the students of more than 100 universities to study abroad for 2 quarters.

As student of the [University of Padova](http://www.unipd.it) I participated in the last selections and won a grant to study at the [University of California - Irvine](http://uci.edu) for fall and winter quarters.
This win was not a quick result. I started the preparation one year before looking for information and contacts and working hard for my bachelors degree.  
Obviously something has to happen and so I seriously risked to miss the deadline for the selection. I really have to say thanks to Thomas who called me while I was in Spain. Thanks to him and to a big dose of luck that call permitted me to produce all the documentation needed for the selection. (Again Thanks Thomas!!)

After more than 6 months I finally have in my hands the **flight ticket to Irvine** (plus the **J-1 Visa** and the famous document ds2019)

This experience will be a true adventure. Because of me and because the far and the last of this travel everything is a bit unknown. I haven't a precise plan and I don't know what opportunities I will have.

The guide lines of this adventure are few:

  *  One ticket to New York, 27 august - 6.05
  *  One ticket NY to Irvine, deliberately delayed to have some days to visit NY
  *  The faculty of Computer Science of the University of Irvine, in particular the department of Information   
  *  The end of my J-1 visa the 20th of April

**The remain has yet to be wrote :)**
