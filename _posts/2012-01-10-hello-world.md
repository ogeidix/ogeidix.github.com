Hello world, hello people!  
I'm not sure about what happened but, after a long and imprecise time, here we are! This blog is born!  
This blog is far from be completed but now I'm too happy for it's born, it will be kept continuously as a work in progress.

This year will be full of **challenges** with **projects** in evolution, new projects and experiences abroad.
Moreover I'm full of **ideas** about things to try and to improve about myself.

This place will be useful to take **notes** about all of these things while sharing informations about what I will **learn**, **do** and **realize**.

The first wish for this new year is simple:

> This is your LIFE.  
> Do what you love and do it often.  
> If you don't like something, change it.  
> LIFE IS SIMPLE.
