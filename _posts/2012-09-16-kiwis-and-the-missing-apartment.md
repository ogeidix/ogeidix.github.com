Kiwis and the missing apartment 
===============================

It's hard to come back to work after so many vacations. 
Unfortunately the mountain of things to do grew so much that I really needed to take some time to come back to the keyboard and to do some boring works.

However this didn't prevent many funny things to happen, afterall I am in California, guys!

Jet, kiwi super dancer

I was in a pub with the EAP crew when Jet came.   
**Me:** _“Hi, I am Diego and I am temporarily hosted by Shawn”_       
**Jet:** _“Nice to meet you Diego. I am Jet and I am hosted by Shawn too”_   

I had just met my new livingroom-mate!

Jet is EAP student from new zealand and a couchsurfer like me.   
He is really easy going and walking / talking with him is simply too funny.  
We stayed together in Shawn's house and we had a lot of fun and parties.

ps: He can dance quite everything! but I still have to see a complete performance! Jet, let's go clubbing!


A crazy search for an apartment
-------------------------------
While the major part of the other international students had already found the apartment (thanks to friends from here or by joining the oncampus contracts) I was still without an apartment and the time was getting shorter.   
I spent more than a week looking for the apartment, several hours each day trying to reach the impossible: find a nice apartment, close to the campus and... cheap!  
The possibilities were mainly three: OnCampus, the Courts or far-far-away

**First:** OnCampus Housing

The apartments inside the campus perimeter are considered **oncampus**.    
Here you can you use some campus services like free buses and here live The major part of the students.  
This is also the place where there are the **fraternities** and the **sororities** and, obviously, the parties!

<br /><br />
</div>

The students who live oncampus can enjoy many amenities like swimming pools, jacuzzi, barbeque areas, gyms and basketball field that are sparse all around the houses. It's like a touristic village with all the benefits for free!


**Second:** The Courts close to the campus

Out of the campus perimeter (formally Campus drive) there is a big residential area splitted in many "courts".  
Here live students as well as families and people who work at the university. Even if here you are offcampus some of these courts are closer to the campus than some oncampus apartments.

<br /><br />
</div>

This apartments are rented by a private company and come completely without forniture but... even this "courts" have their swimming pool, barbeque and recreational area. 

**Third:** Far Far Away

The last possibility are normal apartments in the near cities like Irvine, Newport or Costa Mesa.   
There you can find cheaper apartments as well single rooms rented by families.   Unfortunately you will be quite far from the campus, you will need a car and you will be excluded from the campus live.   Not a good solution!


A bit (actually a lot) of work

As I said before I dedicated this week to work on my laptop, either for work and for the apartment.   
Quickly the Starbucks became my office and I really spent many hours there.
Here some facts that can tell you the level I reached:

* I started to recognize the people with whom I was "sharing the office" and I started to feel myself at home
* I bought the starbucks card and I was keen to reach the gold level
* The last day of the week, when I arrived in the early morning, the barman called me by name and asked me:   
_"Diego, the usual, right?"_ (I am not joking!!)


Saturday is saturday, let's go to the beach!

After a week of work you need to rest, and what is better than a day in the beach?
Unfortunately my friends were in Los Angeles for a two days trip (I skipped because of the mountain of work to do) but don't worry, just few posts on facebook and I found another group on EAP students to join.

I, Bel (Australia), Sophie (Denmark), Pablo (Spain) and Rie (Giappone) have been in the beach for the whole day and when we came back to the campus we did a nice... BARBEQUE PARTY!

_(In the picture you can see one of the BBQ & Swimming pool areas for the students hosted oncampus.
Nothing to envy to a 10 stars resort!!)_
